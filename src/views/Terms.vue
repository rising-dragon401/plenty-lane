                                We provide an online marketplace that enables registered users of the Website (each,
                                a “<b>Member</b>”) to prepare home-cooked meals (each, a “<b>Meal</b>”) for pick-up at
                                a time and location specified by the Member that prepared such Meal (such Member,
                                a “<b>Cook</b>”).
                            </p>

                                <u>Giving Food to Others</u>. A Cook may prepare a Meal and post the same along with
                                the number of servings on the Website’s “Cook” page after filling-out a series
                                of informational pages. That posting will end up on the Plenty Lane “Eat” page.
                                Any other Member can reserve such Meal and pick-up the same during a one hour time
                                window and place of the Cook’s choice (such consuming Member, an “<b>Diner</b>”).
                                If a Diner takes your Meal, you will receive the number of credits (“<b>Credits</b>”)
                                equivalent to the number of servings actually taken by such Diner. The Cook still
                                receives credit even if a Diner fails to pick-up a Meal.

                                available (i.e. Meals posted by a Cook in your area). Reserve the number of servings
                                you need through the “Reserve a Meal” button. If you take a Meal, your Plenty
                                ane Account (as defined below) will be debited by the number of servings in connection
                                with such Meal. Diners must pick-up the Meals when and where specified by the Cook
                                that prepared the Meal. If you do not pick-up your Meal, and have not cancelled your
                                reservation at least 24 hours in advance, you will still be debited by the number of
                                servings in connection with such Meal.

                                        If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
                                        arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
                                        arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an
                                        in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S.
                                        $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any
                                        arbitration hearings will take place in Austin, TX, unless we both agree to a

                                        enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
